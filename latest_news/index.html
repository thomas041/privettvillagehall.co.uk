        <h4>Most Village Hall events planned for 2020 could not go ahead due to Covid-19 constraints. However, the
            following activities did take place with appropriate social distancing - </h4>

        <h4>Christmas 2020</h4>

        <p>
            <u>12.12.2020 - Wreath making morning</u> - This annual event had to be modified due to Covid-19
            restrictions. Many people came at scheduled times to select the materials they wanted to use and take them
            home to construct
            their wreaths. However, a small party of friends decided to brave the cold and windy conditions and, social
            distancing, to make their wreaths in the Hall porch.

        <h4>There were three Privett Christmas events organised by other groups with support from members of the Privett
            Village Hall committee -
        </h4>

        <p><u>Privett Angel Trail</u> - residents of Privett were encouraged to be part of a Village 'trail' of Angels,
            creating them in their gardens and/or windows for people to walk or cycle around the village and find. There
            were some truly artistic and original creations that appeared.</p>

        <p><u>Christmas Tree and Nativity Display</u> - there was a Christmas Tree and a wonderful Nativity Scene set up
            in the
            Privett Churchyard. This was created out of the offcuts of logs that were a by-product of the churchyard
            clearing project.

        <p><u>Christmas Carols</u> - Socially distanced carol singing took place one chilly, but dry, evening on 23rd
            December.
            All accompanied by a very fine trumpet player!

        <p>
            <u>09.10.2020 - AGM</u> - The meeting was postponed from the Spring but was eventually held at the Village
            Hall in the Autumn, complying with the current law and guidelines. However, attendance was limited and
            unfortunately there was no curry involved!
        </p>

        <p class="bold">September 2020 - Changes to Privett Montessori Nursery</p>

        <p>There has been a Montessori Nursery based in Privett Village Hall since 1988.
        From 2003 the Nursery was run by Kate Pritchard, and it flourished with up to twenty pupils, open mornings and
        afternoons for five days a week. However, Kate decided to retire in 2020 at the end of the Summer term.</p>

       <p>The Village Hall Committee is very pleased that Veronica Van Ingen, who lives in Four Marks, agreed to take over
        the Nursery from Kate and to continue running it along the same lines in the Village Hall. Veronica, with her
        deputy Sarah Hawkins, opened her Nursery in September 2020 fully complying with current Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

        <p>One of the special features of the Nursery is that the rural setting of Privett Village Hall, with its meadow
        area and garden, allowing for stimulating and creative outdoor play and learning in a safe environment,
        providing scope for young children to explore the natural world in our beautiful part of the South Downs.</p>

        <p>The Nursery provides education of pre-school children based on Montessori teaching and learning principles. It
        continues to be a valuable resource for families from the village and the wider neighbourhood. Children from the
        Nursery go on to primary education at a state school in one of the neighbouring villages, or to a private school
        in the area.</p>

        <p>Further details of the Montessori Nursery at Privett are available from its website: www.privettmontessori.co.uk</p>

        <br/>

        <p class="bold">15 February 2019</p>
        <p>This is advance notice that Privett Village Hall Trust has its Annual General Meeting on Saturday 27 April at
            the Village Hall, beginning at 6.30 pm.  Following the great success of last year, the AGM will be followed
            by a Curry and Trifle Night – who said an AGM has to be boring?<br/>
            Full details of the AGM and information about tickets for the Curry and Trifle Night will be given in
            April’s magazine – but save the date now.<br/>
            The committee which runs the Village Hall are looking for new members to be appointed at the AGM and anyone
            who is interested in joining the committee should speak to the Chairman (Graham Flack: tel. 828170; email:
            <a href="mailto:graham.flack@filmorehill.co.uk">graham.flack@filmorehill.co.uk</a>) or the Secretary
            (Bridget Kindler: tel. 828214; email:  bridgetkindler@hotmail.co.uk) for further information.</p>
        <p><img src="../assets/dummies.jpg" alt="Dummies" width="148" height="200" class="leftimg"/>Last week, we held a
            Defibrillator training evening which ended up being so much more than that.   The lovely ladies of Saving
            Lives Together came along to bring us up to date with the very latest wisdom on life saving techniques.  We
            practiced CPR on dummies which made us understand just how hard you have to push, and then were shown the
            inner workings of our defibrillator.</p>
        We now know how hard it will be if we ever have to carry out CPR but how important it will be to have a go – and
        keep going!  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/savinglivestogether.co.uk">www.facebook.com/savinglivestogether.co.uk</a>  
        We cannot recommend them highly enough.  Thank you to everyone involved in organising this evening.

                                         width="112" height="150" class="rightImg"/></p>
        <p>The photo shows the exhibit created by representatives of the village hall for the very successful Privett
            Church Flower Festival.   The theme for the arrangement was &ldquo;Each little flower that opens, Each
            little bird that sings&rdquo; from the well known hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful.    Bright and
            beautiful may well be an ongoing theme in Privett at the moment with the glorious weather we have been
            having – and the recent family barbecue was no exception.  Harvesting is now underway and we look forward to
            the Harvest Supper at the end of September.</p>
        <p class="bold">5 June 2018</p>
        <p>At the AGM in April, which was cunningly run alongside the ever popular curry night to ensure a good turnout,
            our inspirational Chairman Teresa Brown stood down from the Chair after 6 years.   Before that she had been
            Treasurer for 3 years, and we are pleased to say she is staying on the <img
                    src="../assets/20180507_061841.jpg" alt="Defibrilator" width="112" height="200" class="leftimg"/>committee
            for the time being.  A presentation was made to Teresa as a token of gratitude for her contribution to
            village life and of the affection in which she is held.</p>
        We can also report that a new feature may be found at the hall thanks to the fund-raising efforts of Howard
        Bevis of Froxfield Stores and Post Office.   A defibrillator has now been installed by the front door, and it
        would good if we can let as many people in the village know about this as possible.   Howard joined in the Great
        South Run and managed to raise enough money for two defibrillators, one each for Froxfield and Privett.  Many
        thanks go to him for this great effort for our community.

        <p><img src="../assets/Whisky Galore.jpg" alt="Whiskey Galore" width="250" height="140" class="rightImg"/>Over
            the winter months the Village Hall arranges, in conjunction with Moviola, two &quot;Film Plus&quot; evenings
            - the screening, in High Definition and with Dolby sound, of a recent film.&nbsp; The aim is to provide an
            evening which offers more than is available at the nearest Multiplex cinema, and so, together with the film,
            a light supper or substantial snack is provided - &quot;themed&quot;, if possible, to the film which
            follows.&nbsp; The November 2017 screening of the recent remake of &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; was a
            particular success - for their ticket for the evening punters were treated to a whisky-tasting in the course
            of which a local resident, with many years in the whisky trade, explained the secrets of the whisky-making
            process and introduced five different whiskies with tasting notes for all to try.&nbsp; It would be fair to
            say that the film, which followed, was enjoyed in a mellow, comfortable, and appreciative glow!</p>
        <p>More recently, just last weekend we showed the film &ldquo;Lion&rdquo; to a packed hall. This was the true
            story of a lost Indian boy and to put us in the mood for this one, an array of Indian street food was served
            beforehand, along with Cobra beer!</p>
        <p><span class="bold">4 December 2017</span>

        <p><img src="../assets/20171202_123421[597].jpg" alt="Wreath making" width="200" height="112" class="leftimg"/>The
            most recent event at the hall was the annual Christmas wreath-making morning – which this year had more
            options than ever for different types of wreath and other Christmas decorations.  As usual, a productive
            morning was finished with a light lunch and everyone left feeling ready to begin the countdown to Christmas.
        </p>
        The committee have continued to invest in the future of the hall, the latest addition being some new and
        improved lighting.  This can only add to the versatility of the hall and make it more useful to one and all.
        <p class="bold">9 May 2017</p>
        <p>The AGM in April was better attended than usual.  This was probably down to the cheese and wine which had
            been laid on to tempt people!  As usual the AGM was short and sweet, with summaries of the financial
            situation and the activities which have taken place through the previous year, both of which were
            satisfactory.   Several new members were welcomed onto the committee outnumbering the two who stood
            down.<img src="../assets/IMG_1374.jpg" alt="Battle of Cheriton walk" width="200" height="132"
                      class="rightImg"/></p>
        <p>Towards the end of April, a group of around 30 met at the hall on a Saturday morning for a bacon butty and
            hot drink before heading down to nearby Cheriton where we were guided around the site of the Battle of
            Cheriton.   We are indebted to John Seal who enthusiastically helped us imagine how things might have been
            back in 1644.  Thanks again, John. </p>
        <p class="bold">26 February 2017</p>
        <p>It was lovely to see a good crowd at Movie night yesterday.  It’s particularly good to see lots of different
            faces coming along.   I think everyone enjoyed the bespoke locally made sausages in the hot-dogs – we
            certainly had fun discussing the problems in matching shrunken sausage size to hot dog bun size
            beforehand!</p>
        <p>Thanks to Bridget who gave the floor a re-coat of varnish during the half term week – it’s looking all lovely
            and shiny again now.</p>
        <p class="bold">23 January 2017</p>
        <p><img src="../assets/IMG_0090.jpg" alt="Curry Night" width="250" height="166" class="leftimg"/>It may have
            been icy outside, but it was toasty in the hall last Saturday as more than 70 people filled it for Curry
            Night,  justifying it&rsquo;s billing as a &ldquo;very popular event&rdquo;!  Many of those who came brought
            along a home-made curry or trifle and we had a veritable feast.    The variety of curries was huge and they
            were all delicious.   I must just give a special thank you to the trifle-makers who pulled out all the stops
            with a spectacular array – I for, one, did my best to try as many as possible!  </p>
        <p>The new Tuesday night yoga sessions have proved to be very popular.   There is no excuse for a lack of
            exercise for anyone in the area now with weekly classes of yoga on Tuesdays and high energy fitness training
            on Thursdays.  We are lucky to have two great instructors:  it&rsquo;s great to see the hall being used in
            this way.  See the events page for details of both if you would like to try them.</p>
        <p class="bold">5 December 2016</p>
        We’ve just held our annual community wreath-making morning, with more people than ever attending.   We were
        especially pleased to welcome two newbies to the village, Emma and Gillian, and we hope to see them at some of
        our other events.   The next film has just been chosen for the February film night – it will be the recent
        version of The Magnificent Seven.   See events page for details as they emerge, but put 25 February in your new
        2017 diaries now!

        <p><img src="../assets/P1030991.jpg" alt="Christmas Wreath" width="200" height="150" class="rightImg"/>Where
            does the time go?  Well, the most recent event at the hall was another very successful film night.   There
            is quite a large outlay for bringing in the large screen and cinema quality sound from Moviola, so it is
            important that these nights are well supported.   We served up a chilli con carne supper before the movie,
            then a glamorous usherette made her way to the front with a tray of ice-creams during an interlude! (Thanks
            Joanna!)   The film, Florence Foster Jenkins,  was excellent and thoroughly recommended for those who missed
            it.</p>
        Next week we are holding our annual communal wreath-making morning.  This has become a fixture in the diaries of
        anyone who has ever been: such a great way to kick off Christmas, and Privett is very well adorned afterwards!

        <p><img src="../assets/20160717_131359.jpg" alt="Summer BBQ" width="250" height="140" class="leftimg"/>We’ve
            been busy at the hall during the last few weeks.   As nursery school’s summer term ended, we held a family
            barbecue which was blessed with the fine weather we have come to expect at village hall events!  Particular
            thanks go to Cameron and Marites who did a great job cooking all the locally produced meat, to Pam and Keith
            who held the fort in the kitchen and kept the children well supplied with ice cream sodas and last but not
            least to Fiona, who for the <img src="../assets/20160717_131654.jpg" alt="Summer BBQ" width="250"

            strawberries for us all to enjoy!</p>
        <p>Ian made a farewell speech to Jason, Rebekah and their family who were about to return to the USA after
            spending the last few years in Privett: they have all been invited to return at any time!</p>
        Councillor Nick Drew has approved a grant to help us buy a new cooker for the village hall: many thanks again
        Nick!   A thorough clear out of the kitchen has subsequently taken place in order to make way for it, along with
        an overdue spring clean of the rest of the hall.   A huge thank you to Pam and Bridget for overseeing all of
        this.

        <p><img src="../assets/P1040606.jpg" alt="St Georges day feast" width="250" height="213" class="leftimg"/>Privett
            joined in the nation-wide celebrations of the Shakespeare 400th anniversary with a feast and entertainment
            on St George’s Day – it was a special and memorable evening.</p>
        <p> The Village Hall was decorated with St George’s flag bunting and over 40 people sat down to a feast in the
            Elizabethan style, with meat pies, pasties, chicken, ham, fish, cheese, bread, trifles and cakes.  Good
            local ale was served.</p>
        For entertainment we were treated to lute music and extracts from several of Shakespeare’s plays and sonnets. 
        Amanda Cook is a guitar player with an international performance career, and she had carefully chosen, and
        introduced, music of the period, some of which we can be certain Shakespeare would have known.  Five members of
        the Lion and Unicorn Players from Petersfield showed us, in characterful and dramatic readings, Shakespeare
        dealing with love, ambition, vengeance, war and patriotism – our very own Globe Theatre for the evening.

            pilgrimage walk on Good Friday, and being the venue for this year’s Garden Club Spring Show, the hall was
            also used in March when the committee organised a Talk on WWI’s Battle of Jutland to commemorate its
            upcoming 100th anniversary.   This was very much enjoyed by all who attended and many thanks have to go to
            Christopher Knox who gave the talk.  Look out for an interesting exhibition in Portsmouth arranged by the
            National Museum of the Royal Navy.</p>
        <p class="bold">20 February 2016</p>
        We have now held 3 trial film nights, trying out different formats.  Weekends, mid-week, with food options or
        just light refreshments.   The film choices were enjoyed by those who came and movie nights seemed popular in
        general.   We will need to ensure good attendance if we are to continue, as there is quite a significant cost
        involved in providing the excellent cinematic experience!  Any feedback would be gratefully received while we
        discuss what happens next.
        <p class="bold">18 January 2016</p>
        <p>Things got a little hectic at the hall during November and December with the sudden demise of the soakaway.  
            Local builders were approached for quotes and with a bit of luck we were able to get the problem sorted
            during the Christmas holidays with minimal disruption to the Nursery School.  We would very much like to
            thank our Parish Council, EHDC Councillor Nick Drew and Hampshire County Councillor Vaughan Clarke who have
            all contributed to the cost of this emergency work at our time of need and have effectively enabled the hall
            to be kept open!</p>
        <p>Last Saturday was the second of our Movie nights, and on this occasion there was the option to come for a
            curry beforehand.   About 50 people took us up on this offer, with a few more coming along just for the
            film.  Popular opinion seemed to be that the film was good (Dark Horse) and everyone seems to be enjoying
            the concept of cinema coming to Privett.  It is not a cheap enterprise, so we do need good numbers of people
            to come if we are to cover costs and continue.</p>
        Please check out Arts and Crafts dates – so far we have painters, knitters and someone doing crochet.  Everyone
        would be welcome.
        <p class="bold">18 November 2015</p>
        <p>Two new ventures at the hall to mention: -</p>
        <p>Firstly, on 28th November we will be holding our first Movie evening, with the help of Moviola who provide
            films in rural areas.  It seems to be a popular idea, and we hoping this enthusiasm translates into &lsquo;bums
            on seats&rsquo; on the night.  If so, this could be the first of many such evenings.</p>
        Secondly we have now held three arts and crafts sessions at the hall, with another coming up on Saturday 21st
        November at 10 am.  These are simply opportunity to bring along your chosen project and have a go in the
        presence of other like-minded people, and share tips and advice.  There is a minimal £2 charge to cover hall
        costs.    We have had mainly artists, but one knitter also, and we hope to encourage all sorts of crafters to
        come along too.  Please do join us!  Keep an eye on the website for more dates.

        <p>The annual harvest supper was well attended last Saturday and provided an opportunity to try out the new
            festoon party lights which can be used inside or out at the hall.  Thanks go to Nigel for his help in
            putting these lights up.   As usual our friends and neighbours brought along a fine array of dishes for the
            feast.  It was all the more lovely holding this during the most fabulous settled autumn weather.</p>
        We are soon to be holding the first movie night at the hall.   Please keep 28th November free to come and see
        Far from the Madding Crowd.
        <p class="bold">10 August 2015 </p>
        <p>Thursday night fitness has been well supported since beginning in June. There is now going to be a 3-week
            break but it will commence again on Thursday 3 September 7 – 8pm. See 19 May entry for details.</p>
        <p>The early summer months saw two village events at the hall.  Firstly there was a barn dance with music and
            calling provided by Saxon Drain. Many thanks go to them (<a href="http://www.saxondrain.org.uk">www.saxondrain.org.uk)</a>.
            Then in July we held the popular summer barbecue, complete with Pimms and local beer for the adults and a
            bouncy castle for the kids.  Once again Teresa got everyone talking with her quiz to test local knowledge –
            this time it was matching dogs to their owners – luckily it was a picture quiz!</p>
        <p class="bold">19 May 2015</p>
        We are pleased to announce that starting on Thursday 4th June there will be a new Circuit Training Class for
        those wanting to improve fitness.  All levels and abilities are welcome. <a

                                   class="leftimg"/></span>It’s been busy at the hall for the last month or so.  In
            February we held the ever-popular village quiz.  For supper we had organised a visit from The Jolly Fryers
            who provided everyone with award-winning fish and chips.  This went down very well with plenty of beer and
            wine and everyone had fun which was the main thing!</p>
        <img src="../assets/P1020453.jpg" alt="Village Walk" width="150" height="112" class="rightImg"/>The hall was
        briefly transformed into a floral paradise when the Froxfield and Privett Horticultural Society held their
        Spring Show at the hall in March, and just last weekend the hall provided the starting and finishing point for
        an Easter themed walk which took us over the A32 to the 12th century church in West Tisted.  Children and adults
        alike enjoyed the chocolate treats along the way and a hot soup lunch with home-made cakes was most welcome at
        the end.

        <p><span class="bold"><img src="../assets/P1020321.jpg" alt="Curry tasting" width="150" height="200"
                                   class="leftimg"/></span>So what&rsquo;s been happening since Christmas?  Well,
            firstly we have to thank a local working party who took on the challenge, between Christmas and New Year, of
            improving the tree-lined boundary to the hall grounds.  This was a big job as there was a lot of cutting
            back to be done, and then disposal of the waste.  Huge thanks to John Kindler, who knowledgeably organised
            the work, and to the other volunteers... Barry, Nigel, Jason, Cameron, John C and Graham.</p>
        <p>We have just had new, more secure and safer fire doors fitted at the hall, and would like to thank the East
            Hampshire District Council Cabinet for approving a grant to contribute towards the cost of this work.</p>
        <p>And finally, on Saturday night at the suggestion of local Privett resident, Phil, we organised a
            curry-tasting evening.  The committee received the following email.... &ldquo;Just to say how much [we]
            enjoyed last night, and to thank you and everyone else who obviously worked so hard to make it happen. The
            food was absolutely delicious - what talented cooks there are in the village! It was a great idea to have a
            Curry Night in the depths of January, and it was top notch&rdquo;<br/>
            Our sentiments, exactly!  Maybe we should do it again next year?</p>
        If anyone would like to organise or suggest a community event we could hold at the hall, the committee would be
        willing to offer help or assist in any way they can.  Please get in touch.

        On Saturday, creative juices were flowing as more than a dozen of us gathered at the hall to make Christmas
        wreaths for our front doors and other Christmas decorations.  Chat, chocolate biscuits, coffee and mulled wine
        kept us going through the morning, then we finished off with a light lunch.    The finished articles were all
        different, but equally lovely.  Everyone agreed that it was a really enjoyable morning.  Thanks to those who
        supplied all the bits and bobs required – and those who gave advice and shared tips.
        <p class="bold">31 October 2014</p>
        <p>The Harvest Supper was held in the Hall on Saturday 27th September. The event was well supported with over 60
            people in attendance.</p>
        <p>The Committee were pleased that some past Committee members were able to come. Comments were made about the
            strong sense of community that is present in Privett.</p>
        <p>The main course was local cold meats together with home cooked quiches and a variety of interesting and
            colourful salads prepared by residents. This was followed by a superb selection of delicious desserts and
            cheese. The supper was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone.</p>
        Thanks are extended to all who helped before, during and after this first class event.
        <p class="bold">4 September 2014</p>
        <p>During the earlier part of August, committee members Peter and Bridget spent a good many days redecorating
            the lobby and end wall of the main hall, and with help from Nigel and a sander, renovated the wooden floor
            too.  It all looks wonderful, and I’m sure everyone who uses the hall will appreciate their hard work.</p>
        <img src="../originals/P1010332.jpg" alt="50th anniversary dinner" width="200" height="150" class="leftimg"/>It
        was lovely to see so many people at our black tie dinner and dance last Saturday to celebrate 50 years of
        Privett Village Hall, and to make use of our recently renovated venue.  The hall was transformed for the evening
        with fairy lights, and the usual welly boots and country clothing we are used to wearing were cast aside in
        favour of a more glamorous look:  I think we quite surprised ourselves!  We have to thank Angie and her team for
        serving up a fantastic four course dinner, the local youngsters who waited table and manned the bar, and the
        wonderful <a href="http://www.maycontainnutslive.co.uk">May Contain Nuts</a> who played a wide variety of music
        to keep the dance floor full all evening.  Thanks too (ahem!) to Teresa and the rest of the committee for their
        hard work in making this event happen and to all friends from the village who turned up to help with setting up
        and clearing up.  We are also grateful to the many people and organisations who lent us equipment and helped us
        keep costs down.

            again, Privett was blessed with a perfect sunny afternoon for the summer barbecue.  Despite a forecast of
            showers, the committee confidently set up tables and chairs outside and their confidence was rewarded! 
            Around 70 people including many families came along for the afternoon.  The children enjoyed the bouncy
            castle, the adults enjoyed the <img src="../assets/P1010078 (150x113).jpg" alt="BBQ" width="150"
                                                height="113" class="leftimg"/>Pimms and local beer and everyone enjoyed
            the lunch, expertly cooked by Francis, Kevin and Nic.  A couple of recent birthdays were acknowledged with a
            village-sized chocolate cake, and while we finished our meal with strawberries and cream many of us
            challenged ourselves with a Privett picture quiz.  Many thanks to everyone who helped: too many to mention.

        <p class="bold">9th May 2014</p>
        <p>First World War Evening</p>
        <p><img src="../originals/world war.png" alt="Your Country Needs You!" width="204" height="268"
                class="rightImg"/>An evening event was held at Privett Village Hall on 9th May to commemorate the 100th
            anniversary of the start of the First World War.</p>
        <p> The event was introduced by Ian Hughes who spoke of a visit to Sandham Memorial Chapel, near Newbury. The
            chapel is a memorial to the &lsquo;Forgotten Dead&rsquo;, those who died as a result of the War but are not
            commemorated on a War Memorial. The walls of the chapel feature the work of the war artist Stanley
            Spencer.</p>
        <p> Lieutenant-Colonel Jason Smith of the US Marines referred to his recent visit to the battlefields in France
            and read a poem titled &lsquo;In Memoriam&rsquo; by Ewart Alan Mackintosh. The poem is written to the father
            of one of Lieutenant Mackintosh&rsquo;s men who was lost in battle but it is also a reflection on the
            responsibility felt by the officer towards his men.</p>
        <p> Anne Flynn next spoke of her father, Captain Alexander Beck. He was a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps and
            was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Anne brought along the propeller of his plane together with two
            German crosses cut from the fabric of aircraft he shot down. It was interesting to hear how Anne&rsquo;s
            father took a nonchalant approach to the dangers of flying and aspects of his experiences were amusing.</p>
        <p> Maconochie stew was then served. This was a meat and vegetable dish that was similar to that cooked and
            served in the trenches. </p>
        <p> The evening resumed with a presentation by David Key on the military camps around Winchester. Initially
            these camps were transit camps for soldiers going to France and Belgium. The soldiers came from all parts of
            the British Isles as well as the Empire. Later in the War the camps became bases for specialist army units.
            The conditions in the camps were appalling in bad weather with deep mud on the chalk downland a particular
            difficulty.</p>
        <p> The evening concluded with a talk by Terry Muldoon which focussed on 1914. We learned that at the start of
            the War the army numbered about 500,000, including the Reserves and the Territorials. The initial approach
            was to bring back the regular troops from their bases in the Empire and send them to the Western Front. The
            contribution of the British army at the beginning of the War in 1914 was small and described by The Kaiser
            as &lsquo;a contemptible little army&rsquo;. Many were killed at the battle of Mons but those survivors,
            referred to as &lsquo;the Old Contemptibles&rsquo;, helped train the volunteers and, subsequently, the
            conscripted troops as the war progressed.</p>
        <p> Terry brought some rifles to show and demonstrated how they would have been used.</p>
        As there is so much to present it is hoped to have another event in due course.

                class="leftimg"/>On 10 March we began the second major phase of building work at the hall which was the
            addition of an extension for storage purposes. This work was completed in time for the beginning of the
            nursery school summer term at the end of April. The main hall is now fresh, warm and free <img

                    class="rightImg"/>of all the clutter that used to fill a large part of it!  Security lighting has
            been installed all around the outside.  There are still a few minor renovations to carry out, so we will be
            continuing to fundraise for a little longer, but the bulk of the work has now been done. We will be updating
            the renovation page soon with a list of the many people we would like to thank who have helped us along the
            way.</p>
        <img src="../assets/may walk (150x113).jpg" alt="The May walk" width="150" height="113" class="leftimg"/>We were
        blessed, again, with a gloriously sunny day for the group walk we had arranged through Privett this morning,
        which took in not only the bluebells and flowering rape fields, but also a chance to explore secret parts of the
        church including the crypt and the bell tower where we were given a bell-ringing demonstration.  Afterwards we
        headed back to the hall for the homemade soup, fresh bread and chocolate brownies which has become a popular end
        to the several walks we have now organised.  Many thanks to the soup-makers, the bakers, and those who helped
        with setting up and clearing up.

        <p>March saw us preparing for the commencement of the second phase of building work.  As a result, the AGM was
            rather low key, but the Froxfield and Privett Horticultural Society Spring Show, which went ahead despite
            the building work, more than made up for this with a colourful, well-attended and enjoyable day. </p>

                class="leftimg"/>On 15 February we held a particularly lively quiz, which was very well attended as
            usual. Some of the questions had a &lsquo;valentines&rsquo; theme, but all of them provoked good debate
            within the teams. Many thanks to our regular quiz-master James Plant for this. We were very well looked
            after with food and drink and I&rsquo;m sure everyone will be keen to take part in the next quiz.</p>
        <p>Change is already afoot at the hall, with final preparations for the building work which will  start in a
            couple of weeks time. We are all looking forward to the extra space in the hall, and the extra space for
            storage. Fingers crossed for good weather!</p>

                class="rightImg"/>On Friday evening we held a cookery demonstration with the theme of canapés and
            nibbles, at the village hall.  Local caterer, Angie Trenchard came along with a wealth of different
            ingredients and put together a whole range of tasty treats, both hot and cold, which we were able to try
            with a glass of wine.  Angie was very happy to answer questions and let us have a go at preparing some of
            our own canapés.  We hope everyone went home inspired and satisfied.  Many thanks go to Angie and Teresa for
            organising everything.</p>
        Plans are now well underway for the second phase of building work at the hall which we hope will commence in
        March.  This will see the extension added for storage, along with new lighting inside and out.

            Saturday 7 December, a group of ten ladies spent the morning making Christmas wreaths for their front doors,
            and other Christmas table decorations.  A large amount of greenery had been collected and some accessories
            and ribbons were provided.  Advice and tips were shared and it proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable way of
            carrying out this annual task.   The morning ended with a light lunch.  Everyone agreed this would make an
            excellent annual activity.  </p>
        <p>More recently, we have been canvassing votes to win some funding from the Country Market, Bordon, as one of
            their X-citing projects.  Unfortunately, we didn’t win the vote (we were up against some very worthy
            opponents), however, we were given feedback that indicated we had received a huge amount of support, so we
            would like to thank everyone who voted for us.</p>

        <p>What a busy weekend at the hall.  On Friday night the food experts from Flavour Tastings and Events came
            along to run a Cheese Tasting evening for us.  The theme was England v France and we were treated to a
            variety of lovely cheeses to compare accompanied by a wealth of cheese related information.  Great fun, and
            very tasty! <a href="http://www.flavourtastings.co.uk">www.flavourtastings.co.uk</a>  <br/>

            all that cheese, many of those who came on Friday night were glad they had signed up for the Local Interest
            Walk which had been arranged for the next morning.  Around 70 people joined us on a beautiful sunny morning
            on a walk that took us into the old railway tunnel which runs under Privett and then back into the sunlight
            to walk to the old station which is now a house.  The owners had kindly agreed to show us around the back of
            the house where you can still see the old platform.   Back at the hall, we were rewarded with a choice of
            home-made soups, hunks of fresh bread and butter, and homemade cakes.  I think it’s safe to say everyone is
            looking forward to the next organised <img src="../assets/tunnel (200x133).jpg" alt="privett train tunnel"

            the spring, and will hopefully include a visit to the less accessible parts of Privett’s church: the crypt
            and the bell-tower.</p>

        <p class="bold">Supported by Hampshire County Council</p>
        <p>We are very pleased to announce that we have successfully applied to Hampshire County Council for funding for
            our village hall renovation and extension project and they have awarded us a grant of up to 25% of the
            actual project costs (to a maximum £25,000).  This puts us in the position of having enough funding to go
            ahead and complete the project as soon as this can be arranged.  Building work is likely to take place in
            the spring next year.</p>

        <p>It was lovely to be able to use the hall for a social event after the first stage of the renovation was
            carried out during the summer.  The occasion was a Harvest Lunch and over 60 people from the village got
            together for a delicious buffet lunch.   It was particularly pleasing to see representatives from all age
            groups there, as well as some new faces, and I think it’s fair to say that everyone enjoyed themselves.</p>

        <p>We are hoping to hear the outcome of two more grant applications quite soon, and if successful, we will be
            able to look towards starting the second stage of the renovation early next year.</p>

                 class="rightImg"/>The first phase of the renovations has been completed ahead of schedule and we are
            very pleased with the results. Many thanks to Stephen Rozario, our builder, and his team for a great job (<a

            <br/>
            The new insulated roof, insulated walls, and new boiler and radiators should mean that the hall stays cosy
            and dry inside during cold and wet spells: neither of which were possible before. And the new porch not only
            looks very grand, but will offer a large sheltered area outside all year round. <br/>
            <br/>
            The next month or two will hopefully see us making a start on the next stage which is an extension for
            storage with accompanying electrical work and updated lighting in the hall. Just a final fundraising push
            needed.</p>

                 class="leftimg"/>Great progress is being made at the hall with the first phase of building work well
            underway. The new roof is on, the walls have been insulated and a grand new porch is taking shape. By the
            time the school term starts there should be a new heating system in place too. The future is looking warm
            and cosy in Privett Village Hall!</p>

        <p>A big Thank You to Alex for letting us use her beautiful garden in Filmore Hill for our summer picnic last
            Sunday. It was very hot but luckily there were shady spots to sit and chat (and check on the latest cricket
            score!) and plenty of ice for the Pimms and home made elderflower cordial, as well as a delicious selection
            of contributions for the picnic table.
        </p>
        <p>There is also more news about grants we have been given for the renovations: we are grateful to the
            co-operative community membership fund for £1,900 towards the new porch and to the Garfield Weston
            Foundation for £3,000. We have also been promised another £6,198 from the local developers fund, so thanks
            also go to EHDC.</p>
        <p>We hope to have more news about the start of building work very soon. </p>

            We are thrilled to announce that we have been granted £10,000 from the Big Lottery Fund towards the cost of
            the new roof for the hall. Work on the roof is due to take place this summer.</p>

                 height="113" class="leftimg"/>Last night, on a beautiful sunny evening at the hall, there was a flower
            arranging demonstration given to us by the lovely Pam Smout and assisted by her friend Sam. Pam very
            thoughtfully showed us how to use the sorts of flowers that we might easily find in our gardens or the
            hedgerows to make several gorgeous arrangements. These were then raffled off at the end so that several
            lucky people took arrangements home with them.<br/>
            <br/>
            Pam is clearly passionate about flower arranging but also loves to help good causes at the same time, so
            we'd like to thank Pam very much for coming along to Privett to help us with our fundraising and for giving
            us an inspiring demonstration.</p>

        <p><img src="../assets/Auction (200x150).jpg" alt="Getting Ready for the auction" width="200" height="150"
                class="rightImg"/>The auction on 11 May was a really big event for us.  The idea came from Jonathan
            Pratt who, aware of our need to raise funds for work at the village hall, volunteered his services as
            auctioneer.  Inexperienced as we were, we took on the challenge of first finding items to auction, then
            sorting them, cataloguing them and in some cases, just identifying them!   We also had to &lsquo;up our game&rsquo;
            when it came to advertising and promoting as we hoped to pull in a larger audience than we are used to.</p>
        <p>By the evening of Friday 10th – we had filled Privett Church with over 300 items for the auction: a great
            many people turned out to help for which the committee were very grateful.</p>
        <p>A good crowd arrived by Saturday afternoon, and there was an excited buzz in the air while viewing took
            place.  Local beer, locally made pasties and home-made cakes were among the refreshments provided, while
            activities were organised for young children in the Privett Centre next door.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Pratt proved to be an enthusiastic, knowledgeable and entertaining auctioneer and he refused to let
            a single item remain unsold.  He did an absolutely magnificent job and we couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased
            with the outcome.  An exact figure will be revealed soon, but it looks like it will be around £7,000.  Just
            as importantly, it seemed like everyone who came had a good day.</p>
        <p>One of the most rewarding things about being involved with this auction was that so many people stepped in to
            help make it the great success it was.  Thank you to everyone: too many to name here! </p>
